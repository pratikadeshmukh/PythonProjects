Customer Lifetime value - 
      1) CLV is the total amount spent by the customer on an average during his entire lifetime relationship with the company and 
         how much our customers like our products or services which tells us what exactly are we doing right and what are the areas where we need to improve.
      2) Three important goals of CLV calculation– Distinguish active custs from inactive,predict the purchase volume of customers and 
         forecast transactions of each individual customer.
      3) CLV = Expected no. of transactions x Revenue per transaction x Margin
        Expected no. of transactions – is calculated using BG/NBD model,this model also predicts the probability that the customer is active or not
        Revenue per transaction – calculated using gamma gamma model

Customer Segmentation - 
        Customer Segmentation is a process to find out who are our most loyal customers or who are the ones who visit the ecommerce website infrequently 
        or we can say they are one time visitors. Customer segmentation allows companies to target customers who have specific needs and desires ,
        this way companies can design target campaigns efficiently to the right group or audience.
